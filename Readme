Project Status

We have scraped datasets from four darkweb marketplaces and performed initial analysis. The project is ongoing and we aim to complete it by December.

DATASETS

| Marketplace | Records | Images Available? |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Vortex      | 20,000  | Yes               |
| Archtype    | 200     | No                |
| MGM         | 4,753   | Yes               |
| Bohemia     | 6,800   | No                |


Data preprocessing has been completed for all four marketplaces.

Images were scraped for MGM and Vortex, while Archtype and Bohemia currently have no images.
  

-> Next Steps

1) Perform vendor profiling analysis for all marketplaces.

2) Use computer vision techniques on datasets with images to analyze products.

3) Integrate insights from both tabular and image data to complete the project by December.
